# Problem 1

```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

```{r}
nrow(penguins)
ncol(penguins)
```

```{r}
mean.default(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```

In this data set, there are 8 variables  and 344 observations for penguins. 
The variables include:species, island, length of bill (mm), depth of bill (mm),
flipper length (mm), body mass (g), sex, and year of birth? 
The mean flipper length of penguins in the data set is 200.92 mm.

## Problem 1- Plots

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color= species))+ geom_point(na.rm = TRUE)
ggsave("penguin_plot.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
```

# Problem 2

```{r dataframe_creation}
icecream_df= tibble(
  icecream= rnorm(10),
  icecream_logical= icecream > 0,
  icecream_char = c("vanilla", "chocolate", "strawberry", "mintcc", "cookiescream", "rockyroad", 
                     "birthdaycake", "coffee", "butterpecan", "saltedcaramel"),
  icecream_factor = factor(c("base", "base", "addin", "newflavor", "addin", "addin",
                              "addin", "newflavor", "addin", "newflavor"))
  )
icecream_df
```
```{r}
mean(pull(icecream_df,icecream))
mean(pull(icecream_df,icecream_logical))
mean(pull(icecream_df,icecream_char))
mean(pull(icecream_df,icecream_factor))
```
In this new data frame, variables that are numeric are able to have a mean value generated
for them, as observed with ice cream due to it having a value between 0 and 1. However,
due to the other variables being character variables with no value assigned to them, a mean
value cannot be generated.

```{r}
as.numeric(pull(icecream_df, icecream_logical))
as.numeric(pull(icecream_df, icecream_char))
as.numeric(pull(icecream_df, icecream_factor))
```
When using the numeric function for each of the variables, it is evident why a mean
value could not be taken. For the logical vector, the values outputted were 0 and 1 
signifying the true and false response generated, however a mean value cannot be taken 
of these responses as it is not possible to have a middle value for true or false in
the frame. For the character vector, all responses were NA due to the character nature 
thus with no numeric value they cannot have a generated mean. Lastly, for the factor
vector, the output was the levels from 1 to 3, however similar to the logic vectors, there
cannot be a mean response of the three levels created, as each of these level values
are also arbitrarily assigned values. As a result a mean cannot be taken for these variables
due to the returned values being uninterpretable in the context of the data frame.
