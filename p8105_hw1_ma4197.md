### Observations

``` r
nrow(penguins)
```

    ## [1] 344

``` r
ncol(penguins)
```

    ## [1] 8

In this data set, there are 8 variables and 344 observations for
penguins. The variables include:species, island, length of bill (mm),
depth of bill (mm), flipper length (mm), body mass (g), sex, and year of
birth.

### Mean Flipper Length

``` r
mean.default(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```

    ## [1] 200.9152

The mean flipper length of penguins in the data set is 200.92 mm.

### Plots

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color= species))+    geom_point(na.rm = TRUE)
```

``` r
ggsave("penguin_plot.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
```

# Problem 2

### Create Data Frame

``` r
icecream_df= tibble(
  icecream= rnorm(10),
  icecream_logical= icecream > 0,
  icecream_char = c("vanilla", "chocolate", "strawberry", "mintcc", "cookiescream", "rockyroad", 
                     "birthdaycake", "coffee", "butterpecan", "saltedcaramel"),
  icecream_factor = factor(c("base", "base", "addin", "newflavor", "addin", "addin",
                              "addin", "newflavor", "addin", "newflavor"))
  )
icecream_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    icecream icecream_logical icecream_char icecream_factor
    ##       <dbl> <lgl>            <chr>         <fct>          
    ##  1    0.548 TRUE             vanilla       base           
    ##  2    1.20  TRUE             chocolate     base           
    ##  3    1.61  TRUE             strawberry    addin          
    ##  4   -2.41  FALSE            mintcc        newflavor      
    ##  5    1.25  TRUE             cookiescream  addin          
    ##  6    0.240 TRUE             rockyroad     addin          
    ##  7   -0.161 FALSE            birthdaycake  addin          
    ##  8   -0.802 FALSE            coffee        newflavor      
    ##  9   -1.03  FALSE            butterpecan   addin          
    ## 10    0.242 TRUE             saltedcaramel newflavor

### Mean of Each Variable in DF

``` r
mean(pull(icecream_df,icecream))
```

    ## [1] 0.06847885

``` r
mean(pull(icecream_df,icecream_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(pull(icecream_df,icecream_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(icecream_df, icecream_char)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(icecream_df,icecream_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(icecream_df, icecream_factor)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

### Reasoning

In this new data frame, variables that are numeric are able to have a
mean value generated for them, as observed with ice cream due to it
having a value between 0 and 1. A mean was generated for the ‘icecream’
and ‘icecream_logical’ variables. However, due to the other variables
being character variables with no value assigned to them, a mean value
cannot be generated.

### Numeric Function

``` r
as.numeric(pull(icecream_df, icecream_logical))
```

    ##  [1] 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1

``` r
as.numeric(pull(icecream_df, icecream_char))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
as.numeric(pull(icecream_df, icecream_factor))
```

    ##  [1] 2 2 1 3 1 1 1 3 1 3

When using the numeric function for each of the variables, it is evident
why a mean value could not be taken. For the logical vector, the values
outputted were 0 and 1 signifying the true and false response generated,
however a mean value cannot be taken of these responses as it is not
possible to have a middle value for true or false in the frame. For the
character vector, all responses were NA due to the character nature thus
with no numeric value they cannot have a generated mean. Lastly, for the
factor vector, the output was the levels from 1 to 3, however similar to
the logic vectors, there cannot be a mean response of the three levels
created, as each of these level values are also arbitrarily assigned
values. As a result a mean cannot be taken for these variables due to
the returned values being uninterpretable in the context of the data
frame.
